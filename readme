The internet makes things possible some people dreamt of for years. One of 
these things is the possibility to stream live-voice-chat over the internet. Many people 
used the citizens’ band radio – CB radio – for the last decades:

“Citizens’ Band radio (CB) is, in many countries, a system of short-distance, simplex[1] 
radio communications between individuals on a selection of 40 channels within the 27 MHz 
(11 meter) band. The CB radio service should not be confused with FRS, GMRS, MURS, or 
amateur (“ham”) radio. Similar personal radio services exist in other countries, with 
varying requirements for licensing and differing technical standards. In many countries, 
CB does not require a license and, unlike amateur radio, it may be used for business as 
well as personal communications.”

For several years now there is a group of people from virtually everywhere in germany who 
connect their CB radios to the internet – they link their “gateways” together using a 
software normally used by online gamers called “TeamSpeak”. All you have to do to take a 
look is to read this short how-to and follow the steps.
